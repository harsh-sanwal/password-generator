# password-generator
A Password Generator project is a simple yet practical application that creates secure, random passwords based on user-defined criteria. It typically allows users to select the password length and choose whether to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols. The generator uses randomization techniques to ensure high entropy, making the passwords difficult to guess or brute-force. This project demonstrates concepts like string manipulation, random number generation, and user input handling, and can be implemented in various programming languages for personal use or as part of larger authentication systems.
